# NFC West-QB

## Description

NFC West QB is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulatioin to interact with the user. I built this project because football stats are a passion of mine. 

## Installation

To install, just fork and clone this repository. Once cloned in your terminal, make sure you cd into the correct folder.

## Usage

To get started type 'json-server --watch db.json' in the terminal to spin up the server and 'open index/html' (for macs) or 'explorer.exe index.html' (for windows). The web app will load to an archive and search page where you can see all the NFC West top QBs.
